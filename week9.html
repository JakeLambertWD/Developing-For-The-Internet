<div class="subtitle"><h1>Introduction to the Slim Framework</h1></div><hr><p>Page 1</p><h1>Why PHP Frameworks</h1>
<ul>
<li>Frameworks are PHP libraries which allow you to develop
complex applications with relativelyt little code</li>
<li>Frameworks allow you to write PHP code which allows for 
<em>separation of concerns</em>, a software engineering principle which
separates the code out into different components responsible for different
actions (e.g. querying the database or presenting the data)</li>
<li>This leads to cleaner and more maintainable code</li>
<li>Frameworks allow you to carry out common tasks with relatively
little code, as the framework contains the code to carry out those tasks
so you don't need to write it yourself</li>
<li>A common pattern in Frameworks is <em>Model/View/Controller</em></li>
<li>This consists of three components:
    <ul>
    <li><em>Model</em> - The data. PHP classes 'wrapping' the database, such as 
    Data Access Objects (DAOs) as discussed last week</li>
    <li><em>View</em> - The presentation of the data. Typically web pages,
    generally written as HTML <em>templates</em> containing PHP code</li>
    <li><em>Controller</em> - objects which <em>control</em> the interaction between the
    model and the view</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 2</p><h1>Available PHP frameworks</h1>
<ul>
<li>Laravel</li>
<li>Symfony</li>
<li><em>Slim Framework</em></li>
<li>We are going to examine Slim as it's lightweight, relatively easy to
get started and does not enforce a particular coding style, so is easier to
understand for PHP beginners</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 3</p><h1>Architecture of a Slim application</h1>
<ul>
<li>Typically contains a single <em>index.php</em> containing handlers for
<em>routes</em></li>
<li>A route is a URL matching a particular pattern, e.g. a student record system
at the University of Romsey, stored in the 'studentreg' folder, might have these URLs:
<pre>www.romsey.ac.uk/studentreg/addstudent - for adding a student
www.romsey.ac.uk/studentreg/liststudents - for listing all students
www.romsey.ac.uk/studentreg/student/{student ID} - for displaying the details of a student
</pre>
The <em>routes</em> in this example would be:
<pre>/addstudent
/liststudents
/student/{student ID}
</pre>
</li>
<li><em>All three URLs</em> here would be handled by <em>a single index.php</em>
with Slim</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 4</p><h1>Introducing .htaccess</h1>
<ul>
<li><em>.htaccess</em> is an Apache configuration file which allows URLs
to be <em>rewritten</em></li>
<li>It is used by the Apache module (extension) <em>mod_rewrite</em></li>
<li>It is often used to allow "clean", easy-to-remember
URLs to be used, rather than URLs including query string details</li>
<li>For example a .htaccess file could be used to rewrite the "clean" URL
<pre>hittastic.com/song/123</pre>
to the "real" underlying URL:
<pre>hittastic.com/song.php?id=123</pre>
</li>
<li>Slim uses .htaccess to allow routes (such as those above) to be rewritten
so that they are all rewritten to index.php, and index.php then handles each
route</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 5</p><h1>.htacccess with Slim</h1>
<p>Here is an example of a .htaccess file to be used with Slim:
</p><pre>RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^ index.php [QSA,L]
</pre>
What does this mean?
<ul>
<li>The first line turns the URL rewriting engine on</li>
<li>The second and third check that the requested URL is not an existing
file (-f) or directory (-d)</li>
<li>The fourth and final line rewrites all other URLs to <em>index.php</em></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<hr><p>Page 6</p><h1>Installing Slim - Introduction to Composer</h1>
<p>Slim is a third-party library; it is not part of the core PHP 
distribution. However it is quite easy to install thanks to 
<em>Composer</em>. Composer (see <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">here</a>) 
is a dependency 
management system for PHP projects, allowing you to import specified third-party libraries (<em>dependencies</em> - so called because your project depends on
them). You create a <em>composer.json</em> file specifying which
libraries are needed, and then run an install command, and all necessary
dependencies will be installed. Composer itself can be downloaded as
an application from the Composer site: the Composer application is
a file named <em>composer.phar</em> which is typically saved to your home
directory (~ on Linux systems) and run with PHP, e.g:
</p><pre>php ~/composer.phar (Composer command)</pre>
<p></p>
<p>However on Neptune, Composer is installed globally so you can just use <em>composer</em> to run it.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a composer.json file for Slim:
</p><pre>{
    "require": {
        "slim/slim" : "&gt;=3.0"
    }
}
</pre>
This means, as you might expect, the Slim package is a dependency of
your project, and it needs to be at least version 3.0. You can add
multiple libraries to the "require" block. Once you have setup a 
composer.json, you can then install the dependencies with:
<pre>composer install</pre>
See
<a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/">here</a> for full documentation on
Composer.<p></p>
<p>However you do not have to write the composer.json file yourself. You 
can <em>require</em> a package by running Composer's require command,
e.g. by running this in your project directory:
</p><pre>composer require slim/slim</pre>
This will generate a composer.json automatically, and will also load all
the dependencies.<p></p>
<p>The dependencies will be downloaded to a <em>vendor</em> directory within
your project directory. Also, an <em>autoload.php</em> will be generated in
this project directory, allowing you to automatically include all the
necessary PHP files for all dependencies. 
So in your PHP code, you can simply add:
</p><pre>&lt;?php
require("vendor/autoload.php");
...
</pre>

<li><strong>In particular, see the
<a href="https://www.slimframework.com/docs/v3/tutorial/first-app.html">
First Application Walkthrough</a> tutorial.</strong> This explains the concepts
covered here, but in more detail.</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 8</p><h1>Hello World with Slim</h1>
<p>The example below is the Hello World of Slim. Note that it's 
annotated with comments.</p>
<pre>// Import classes from the Psr library (standardised HTTP requests and responses)
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface as Request;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface as Response;

// Include all the Slim dependencies. Composer creates an 'autoload.php' inside
// the 'vendor' folder which will, in turn, include all required dependencies.
require 'vendor/autoload.php';


// Create a new Slim App object.
$app = new \Slim\App;

// Setup a route (see below)
$app-&gt;get('/', function (Request $req, Response $res, array $args) {
    $res-&gt;getBody()-&gt;write('Hello World from Slim!');
    return $res;
});

// Run the application
$app-&gt;run();
</pre>
<p>Note how we we handle a <em>routes</em>. A route is a particular URL;
typically the URL is a "clean" URL of the sort
described above.
Slim allows us to set up routes very easily, for both 'GET' and 'POST' methods.
Here we are simply handling the top level route, i.e. the application's base URL.
For example for the Romsey University student registration system described above,
it might be:
</p><pre>http://romsey.ac.uk/studentreg/</pre>
without any additional routes.<p></p>
<p>The handler for the route is a function which takes three parameters,
<em>$req</em> representing the HTTP request, <em>$res</em> representing the
HTTP response, and <em>$args</em> for any arguments sent to the application
(see below). In this example we call the <em>send()</em> method of the
response object to send back <em>Hello World from Slim!</em> to the 
client.</p>
<hr><p>Page 9</p><h1>Example with multiple routes</h1>
<pre>// Import classes from the Psr library (standardised HTTP requests and responses)
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface as Request;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface as Response;

// Include all the Slim dependencies. Composer creates an 'autoload.php' inside
// the 'vendor' folder which will, in turn, include all required dependencies.
require 'vendor/autoload.php';


// Create a new Slim App object.
$app = new \Slim\App;



$app-&gt;get('/hello', function(Request $req, Response $res, array $args) {
    $res-&gt;getBody()-&gt;write('Hello World!');
    return $res;
});


$app-&gt;get('/time', function(Request $req, Response $res, array $args) {
    $res-&gt;getBody()-&gt;write("There have been ". time() ." milliseconds since 1/1/70.");
    return $res;
});
$app-&gt;run();
</pre>
<p>This example sets up two routes '/hello' and '/time'. The first will
send back 'Hello World!' and the second will send back the number of 
milliseconds since January 1st 1970. You could set up <em>POST</em>
routes
with <em>$app-&gt;post()</em>; we will see an example of this later.</p>
<hr><p>Page 10</p><h1>URL placeholders</h1>
<p>Slim allows us to easily specify placeholders for variable URLs,  e.g we could
define a route such as:
</p><pre>/artist/{artistname}
</pre>
Here, <em>artistname</em> is a placeholder which can be replaced by any artist, so that
the following would match on the <em>hittastic.com</em> server:
<pre>http://hittastic.com/artist/Oasis
http://hittastic.com/artist/Madonna
</pre>
Both of these would be handled by the <em>artist</em> route, with the {artistname}
placeholder representing the specified artist. We can then use the <em>$args</em> array
passed into the handler to retrieve the actual value of the placeholder.<p></p>
<p>Here is a full example which counts up to a given number defined by a placeholder:
</p><pre>// Import classes from the Psr library (standardised HTTP requests and responses)
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface as Request;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface as Response;

// Include all the Slim dependencies. Composer creates an 'autoload.php' inside
// the 'vendor' folder which will, in turn, include all required dependencies.
require 'vendor/autoload.php';


// Create a new Slim App object.
$app = new \Slim\App;



app-&gt;get('/countTo/<em>{ntimes}</em>', function(Request $req, Response $res, array $args) {
    for($count=1; $count&lt;$args['ntimes']; $count++) {
        $res-&gt;getBody()-&gt;write("$count &lt;br /&gt;");
    }
    return $res;
});


$app-&gt;run();
</pre>
Note how this will setup the route <em>/countTo</em> followed
by a placeholder <em>{ntimes}</em>
representing the number of times. So API endpoints such as
<pre>http://server/countTo/3
http://server/countTo/6
http://server/countTo/goat
</pre>
will be matched. (There is no check that ntimes is numeric, so the final
URL will be matched. However you can use regular expressions in Slim
routes to ensure that only numbers are passed in the placeholder; see
<a href="https://www.slimframework.com/docs/v3/objects/router.html">here</a>).
<p></p>
<p>
To access the named placeholder from the PHP code, we use the <em>$args</em> parameter
to our handler function, so, in this example, we would use <em>$args['ntimes']</em> to 
access the specified number of times.</p>
<p>Note we can specify more than one parameter, eg:
</p><pre>// Import classes from the Psr library (standardised HTTP requests and responses)
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface as Request;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface as Response;

// Include all the Slim dependencies. Composer creates an 'autoload.php' inside
// the 'vendor' folder which will, in turn, include all required dependencies.
require 'vendor/autoload.php';


// Create a new Slim App object.
$app = new \Slim\App;



app-&gt;get('/countTo/<em>{ntimes}</em>/step/<em>{step}</em>', function(Request $req, Response $res, array $args) {
    var response = '';
    for($count=1; $count&lt;$args['ntimes']; $count+=<em>$args['step']</em>) {
        $res-&gt;getBody()-&gt;write("$count &lt;br /&gt;");
    }
    return $res;
});


$app-&gt;run();
</pre>
This example will match a route in which a <em>step</em> is supplied in
the URL, which specifies the step to count up with. So:
<pre>http://server/countTo/9/step/2
</pre>
will produce a response counting from 1 to 9 in steps of 2.<p></p>
<hr><p>Page 11</p><h1>Handling POST data</h1>
<p>How do we handle POST data in Slim? Firstly, we set up a 'post' rather than
a 'get' route, and then we use the request's <em>getParsedBody()</em> method
to extract the POST data. For example, this sets up a POST route <em>addStudent</em>:
</p><pre>// Import classes from the Psr library (standardised HTTP requests and responses)
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface as Request;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface as Response;

// Include all the Slim dependencies. Composer creates an 'autoload.php' inside
// the 'vendor' folder which will, in turn, include all required dependencies.
require 'vendor/autoload.php';


// Create a new Slim App object.
$app = new \Slim\App;

$app-&gt;post('/addStudent', function (Request $req, Response $res, array $args) {
    $post = $req-&gt;getParsedBody();
    $res-&gt;getBody()-&gt;write("Student details : Name: ". $post['name']. " Username: ". $post['username']. " Course: " . $post['course']);
    return $res;
});


$app-&gt;run();
</pre>
<p></p>
<hr><p>Page 12</p><h1>Setting up database connections - using a dependency injection container</h1>
<p>The examples so far have simply displayed data, to illustrate route handling. However a
real app would obviously need to actually <em>perform database queries</em>. How do we do
this? For maximum flexibility, Slim does not have its own database connection functionality -
instead, you as the developer can use whichever database connection library (such as PDO)
you like.</p>
<p>Slim introduces the concept of a <em>dependency injection container</em>. Dependency
injection is a software development pattern which is designed to avoid dependencies of
one library on another by placing ("injecting") these dependencies in a 
<em>container object</em>
which is independent of the objects making up our chosen framework (such as Slim).</p>
<p>In this way, Slim is not dependent on a particular database library, for example, but
can work with whichever database library has been placed in this container object.
So, if we are using PDO, we can place our PDO connection inside the container and refer to
it in our route handlers. The example below shows this:
</p><pre>
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface as Request;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface as Response;

require 'vendor/autoload.php';


$app = new \Slim\App;

$container = $app-&gt;getContainer();

$container['db'] = function() {

    $conn = new PDO("mysql:host=localhost;dbname=ephp001", "ephp001", "password");
    $conn-&gt;setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_DEFAULT_FETCH_MODE, PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
    return $conn;
};


$app-&gt;get('/student/{id}', function (Request $req, Response $res, array $args) {
    $stmt = $this-&gt;db-&gt;prepare("SELECT * FROM students WHERE studentid=?");
    $stmt-&gt;bindParam (1, $args['id']);
    $stmt-&gt;execute();
    $row = $stmt-&gt;fetch();
    $res-&gt;getBody()-&gt;write("Student name ". $row['name']. " Course: " . $row['course']);
    return $res;
});

$app-&gt;run();
</pre>
Note in the example how we obtain the Slim app's container with:
<pre>$container = $app-&gt;getContainer();</pre>
and then add a <em>db</em> field to the container, which is set equal to a function which
<em>returns</em> the PDO database connection.<p></p>
<p>Note also how we refer to the database connection in the <em>/student/{id}</em> route
handler.We're using <em>$this-&gt;db</em> to refer to the PDO database connection; note how
this corresponds to the <em>db</em> field of the container object.</p>
<hr><p>Page 13</p><h1>HTML templates</h1>
<p>So far, we've simply written out the response with <em>$res-&gt;getBody()-&gt;write()</em>.
However this could quickly get tedious if we have to write out an entire web page, so
luckily, there's an easier way and that is to define <em>HTML templates</em>. An
HTML template is an HTML page with small sections of PHP - rather similar, in fact, to
the PHP code you've seen so far. The idea is that you seperate out your HTML templates from
your index.php route-handling code, arguably keeping your code cleaner and easier to follow
and maintain.</p>

<p>There are various approaches you can take to templates, including a special templating
language (Twig) or plain PHP. We will use plain PHP as this is just an introductory session on
Slim. PHP templates are typically saved with the <em>.phtml</em> extension to indicate that
they're mostly HTML with just a little PHP.</p>

<p><strong>Note that to use PHP templates you must include another dependency
with Composer:</strong>
</p><pre>php ~vmadmin/composer.phar require slim/php-view</pre>
<p></p>

<p>This example uses a template to display search results. Note the code comments, which
explain the new features of the code:
</p><pre>
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface as Request;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface as Response;

require 'vendor/autoload.php';



$app = new \Slim\App;

$container = $app-&gt;getContainer();

$container['db'] = function() {
    $conn = new PDO("mysql:host=localhost;dbname=ephp001", "ephp001", "password");
    $conn-&gt;setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_DEFAULT_FETCH_MODE, PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
    return $conn;
};

$container['view'] = new \Slim\Views\PhpRenderer('views');

$app-&gt;get('/findStudentsByCourse/${course}', function (Request $req, Response $res, array $args) {
    $stmt = $this-&gt;db-&gt;query("SELECT * FROM students WHERE course=?");
    $stmt-&gt;bindParam (1, $args['course']);
    $stmt-&gt;execute();

    $res = $this-&gt;view-&gt;render($res, 'searchresults.phtml', ['results'=&gt;$stmt, 'course'=&gt;$args['course']]);    
    return $res;
});
</pre>
Note the following. Firstly we add our view object (representing the HTML page)
 to the container, just like we did for the database connection. This allows Slim to work
with multiple approaches to templates. Here we are using the PHP renderer rather than
Twig.
<pre>$container['view'] = new \Slim\Views\PhpRenderer('views');</pre>
Note the argument <em>'views</em>. This is telling the PHP renderer that our templates will
be in the <em>views</em> folder.<p></p>
<p>So in our route handler, we reference the view with <em>$this-&gt;view</em> in the same way
that we reference the database connection with <em>$this-&gt;db</em>. Note how we call the
<em>render()</em> method of the view object and tell it:
    </p><ul>
    <li>the response, <em>$res</em>;</li>
    <li>which template to use here (searchresults.phtml);</li>
    <li>an associative array of data to send to the template. Here, we are sending the 
    database results, the course being searched (used by the template to display the 
    course name)</li>
    </ul>
<p></p>
<p>Now let's look at the template, <em>searchresults.phtml</em>:
</p><pre>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Students on course &lt;?=<em>$course</em>&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;?php
while($row = $results-&gt;fetch())
{
    echo "Student name " . $row['name'] . " Phone number: " .$row['phone'] . "&lt;br /&gt;";
}
?&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
Hopefully you can see that the template is very similar to the mixed HTML/PHP pages you've
done so far. Note how we are using two variables, <em>$course</em> and <em>$results</em>.
Where are they coming from? It's simple to answer that: each variable corresponds to an
index in the associative array sent into the template via the <em>render()</em> function
call in the route handler. Remember from above, the associative array had two fields,
<em>results</em> and <em>course</em> - these will become <em>$results</em>
and <em>$course</em> in the template.<p></p>
<p>Also note the shortcut syntax for echoing out a variable:
</p><pre>&lt;?=<em>$course</em>&gt;</pre>
<p></p>
<hr><p>Page 14</p><h1>Named routes</h1>
<p>Another feature of Slim is <em>named routes</em>. You can give each of your routes a
unique name. Why would you want to do this? It makes it easier to <em>write links to
a given route which will remain the same even if the route itself changes</em>.
Here is an example, which is an extension to the template example above. We'll start with the route handler for <em>findStudentsByCourse</em>, as above:
</p><pre>$app-&gt;get('/findStudentsByCourse/${course}', function (Request $req, Response $res, array $args) {
    $stmt = $this-&gt;db-&gt;query("SELECT * FROM students WHERE course=?");
    $stmt-&gt;bindParam (1, $args['course']);
    $stmt-&gt;execute();

    $res = $this-&gt;view-&gt;render($res, 'searchresults.phtml', ['results'=&gt;$stmt, 'course'=&gt;$args['course'], <em>'router'=&gt;$this-&gt;router</em>]);    
    return $res;
});
</pre>
This route handler is almost the same as the example above, except we are now passing in an additional parameter <em>router</em> 
into our template, which will be accessible in the template with <em>$router</em>.<p></p>
<p>Here is the altered template:
</p><pre>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Students on course &lt;?=<em>$course</em>&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;?php

while($row = $results-&gt;fetch()) 
{
     echo "Student name " . $row['name'] . " Phone number: " .$row['phone'] . "&lt;br /&gt;";
    echo "&lt;a href-'" . $router-&gt;pathFor('marks', ['studentid'=&gt;$row['studentID']]) . "'&gt;Display marks for this student&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;";
}

?&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
Note how each student now has a 'Display marks for this student' link.
Note that this isn't a conventional link to a specific URL but a link to:
<pre>$router-&gt;pathFor('marks', ['studentid'=&gt;$row['studentID']])</pre>
What is this? It's a link to a route with a <em>name</em> of <em>marks</em>. This name is set in the route handler.
The code for the handler for this route might look like this:
<pre>$app-&gt;get('showMarks/{studentid}', function(Request $req, Response $res, array $args) {
    // Handler to show the marks of an individual student (not shown...)
})-&gt;setName('marks');    
</pre>
Note how the <em>showMarks</em> route has been given a <em>name</em> of <em>marks</em>. This will cause any link referring to
<pre>$router-&gt;pathFor('marks'...)</pre>
to link to the route. Even if the route itself changes (e.g. from <em>showMarks</em> to <em>showStudentMarks</em>), as long as the
<em>name</em> remains <em>marks</em>, the link will still function as intended.<p></p>
<p>Note also how we send:
</p><pre>['studentid'=&gt;$row['studentID']]</pre>
to the 'marks' route from the template. This is setting the 'studentid' placeholder of the route to <em>$row['studentID']</em>, 
allowing the 'marks' route to look up the marks of the student with that ID.<p></p>
