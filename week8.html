<div class="subtitle"><h1>Object-oriented PHP</h1></div><hr><p>Page 1</p><h1>Health Warning!!!</h1>
<ul>
<li>This topic is <em>more advanced</em> and is mostly geared towards those of
you who want to do WAD and/or want to do web development in your career</li>
<li>It is also necessary for <em>Task G</em> in the assignment, which is
one of the options (besides AJAX) for obtaining an A</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 2</p><h1>PHP objects: an introduction</h1>
<ul>
<li>
Like Java, PHP features the concept of <em>objects</em>. </li>
<li>An object is a complex data structure representing a real world entity, such as a person, a cat or a 
web page element.</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 3</p><h1>Classes and Objects</h1>
<ul>
<li>When doing object oriented-programming, you need to be aware of the difference between 
<em>classes</em> and <em>objects</em>. </li>
<li>A class is a general description, or blueprint, of something while an 
object is a particular example, or instance, of that class. </li>
<li>For example:
    <ul>
    <li>Dog is a class; Lassie, Fido and Bowser are Dog objects.</li>
    <li>Popstar is a class; Madonna and Michael Jackson are Popstar objects.</li>
    <li>Room is a class; RM602, RM603, RM605 and RM607 are Room objects.</li>
    <li>Country is a class; the UK and Germany are Country objects.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 4</p><h1>Attributes and methods</h1>
<ul>
<li>Classes contain 
<em>attributes</em> which describe objects of that class (e.g. the name and age of a person), and 
<em>methods</em> which change the state of objects of that class 
(e.g. if we have an object representing a car, we might have methods to start and stop the car).
</li>
<li> Methods are a specialised type of function which relate to objects.</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 5</p><h1>Example of a class</h1>
<p>Here is a simple example where we define a Student object representing a student.
</p><pre>&lt;?php

<em>
class Student
{
    // Attributes
    private $name;
    private $course;
    
    // methods
    function __construct($nameIn,$courseIn)
    {
        $this-&gt;name=$nameIn;
        $this-&gt;course=$courseIn;
    }

    function display()
    {
        echo "Name " . $this-&gt;name . " Course " .$this-&gt;course;
        echo "&lt;br /&gt;";
    }
};
</em>

$student1 = new Student("John" , "Software Engineering");
$student2 = new Student("Surjan" , "Web Design");
$student1-&gt;display();
$student2-&gt;display();
?&gt;
</pre>
<p></p>
<hr><p>Page 6</p><h1>How the example works</h1>
<ul>
<li>
The actual Student class is the section of code highlighted.</li>
<li>We create a class called Student and then define the <em>constructor</em>
 with __construct(). </li>
<li>The constructor is a special piece of code which runs when we create a new object of that class. 
It initialises the name and course of a student to a name and course passed in from outside.  </li>
<li>Note that <em>$this</em> is a reference to the current object and the arrow -&gt; 
is used to select the attribute or method we're currently referring to.</li>
<li> The highlighted code does not create any objects; it merely defines how a Student class works.
</li>
<li>
The actual object creation is
done instead in the code below:
<pre>$student1 = new Student("John" , "Software Engineering");
$student2 = new Student("Surjan" , "Web Design");
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 7</p><h1>More on how the example works</h1>
<ul>
<li>
Note the use of the keyword <em>new</em> 
to create new objects of the Student class. Two new objects, student1 and student2, are created. 
</li>
<li>When we create a Student object, the constructor (see above) is called to initialise the objects.
</li>
<li> Note how, for the first object, we pass the values "John" and "Software Engineering" to the constructor. The parameters to the 
constructor, $nameIn and $courseIn, will take on the values "John" and "Software Engineering" 
respectively, as these are the two pieces of information that have been passed in. The constructor then 
sets the name and course attributes to these two values. </li>
<li>
Therefore, the object $student1 will have a name attribute of "John" and a course attribute of 
"Software Engineering".</li>
<li>Finally we call each student's display() method:
<pre>$student1-&gt;display();
$student2-&gt;display();
</pre>
As can be seen from the class, the display method displays the details of that student.
</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 8</p><h1>Another example: a Dog class</h1>
<pre>&lt;?php
class Dog
{
    private $name, $weight;
    function __construct($nameIn,$weightIn)
    {
        $this-&gt;name=$nameIn;
        $this-&gt;weight=$weightIn;
    }

    
    function display()
    {
        echo $this-&gt;name . " " . $this-&gt;weight . "&lt;br /&gt;";
    }

    function walk()
    {
        if($this-&gt;weight &gt; 10)
        {
            $this-&gt;weight --;
        }
        else
        {                
            echo("The poor dog will be half starved ".
                    "if you walk it that far!!!");
        }
    }
};

$dog1 = new Dog("Fido", 11);
$dog2 = new Dog("Lassie", 13);
$dog1-&gt;display();
$dog2-&gt;display();
$dog1-&gt;walk();
$dog1-&gt;display();
$dog1-&gt;walk();
$dog1-&gt;display();

?&gt;
</pre>
<hr><p>Page 9</p><h1>Notes on the Dog Example</h1>
<ul>
<li>
Note how the walk() method of Dog is defined in the class. It simulates walking the dog by reducing the 
weight by one, but if the weight goes below 10, the dog refuses to walk as he/she doesn't want to starve!!!
</li>
<li>This illustratrates the general concept of <em>data hiding</em></li>
<li>The attributes are <em>private</em>, meaning that the outside world cannot access them</li>
<li>The only way of accessing the attributes is via the methods</li>
<li>This technique prevents the outside world arbitrarily manipulating the attributes, for example
we cannot set the weight to below 10 directly with code such as:
<pre>$dog-&gt;weight = 0;</pre>
</li>
<li>The methods describe the permitted operations on the attributes, preventing unrealistic
things happening</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 10</p><h1>Methods with Parameters</h1>
<ul>
<li>
In the previous example, the 
<em>walk()</em>method always has the same effect: the dog's weight is reduced by one. 
</li>
<li>However, the walk() method could be made more sophisticated: we might want to vary the distance the 
dog walks</li>
<li>We could do this by supplying a <em>parameter</em> to the walk() method, 
which specifies the distance to walk</li>
<li> The following extract illustrates this:
<pre>function walk($distance)
{
    if($this-&gt;weight-$distance &gt; 10)
    {
        $this-&gt;weight -= $distance;
    }
    else
    {                
        echo("The poor dog will be half starved ".
                    "if you walk it that far!!!");
    }
}
</pre>
</li>
<li>We would then call the method in this way (assuming $dog is a Dog object:
<pre>$dog2-&gt;walk(2);
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 11</p><h1>Including PHP classes</h1>
<ul>
<li>The examples above showed the class and the code which creates objects of that class in the same
file</li>
<li>Commonly, however, each PHP class is saved in its own file (so it can be <em>reused</em>) and then included
into other scripts</li>
<li>e.g. Dog.php might contain a Dog class:
<pre>&lt;?php
// Dog.php

class Dog
{
    private $name, $weight;
    function __construct($nameIn,$weightIn)
    {
        $this-&gt;name=$nameIn;
        $this-&gt;weight=$weightIn;
    }

    
    function display()
    {
        echo $this-&gt;name . " " . $this-&gt;weight . "&lt;br /&gt;";
    }

    function walk()
    {
        if($this-&gt;weight &gt; 10)
        {
            $this-&gt;weight --;
        }
        else
        {                
            echo("The poor dog will be half starved ".
                    "if you walk it that far!!!");
        }
    }
};
?&gt;
</pre>
and that would be included into other scripts, e.g.:
<pre>&lt;?php
include("Dog.php");
$dog1 = new Dog("Fido", 11);
$dog2 = new Dog("Lassie", 13);
$dog1-&gt;display();
$dog2-&gt;display();
$dog1-&gt;walk();
$dog1-&gt;display();
$dog1-&gt;walk();
$dog1-&gt;display();
?&gt;
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 12</p><h1>Typical uses of PHP classes and objects</h1>
<ul>
<li>Class to represent a database connection
    <ul>
    <li><em>PDO</em>, which you have been using all along, is actually a class to represent
    a PDO database connection</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li><em>WebPage</em> class to represent a web page</li>
<li>Classes to represent entities from databases, for example in 
HitTastic!, we could have a Hit class, so that when we query the database
for all songs by a given artist, we could store the results in an array
of <em>Hit</em> objects</li>
<li>So-called <em>Data Access Objects</em> are used when accessing databases,
part of the <em>Model-View-Controller</em> pattern</li>
</ul>
<hr><p>Page 13</p><h1>Example of a class to represent a database entity: Person</h1>
<pre>&lt;?php
// Person.php
// File containing the Person class

class Person
{
    private $conn; // the PDO connection
    private $id; // the person ID
    private $row; // the row representing this Person
    
    
    public function __construct($conn, $id)
    {
        $this-&gt;conn = $conn;
        $stmt = $this-&gt;conn-&gt;prepare
            ("SELECT * FROM people WHERE id=?");
        $stmt-&gt;bindParam (1, $id);
        $stmt-&gt;execute();
        $this-&gt;row = $stmt-&gt;fetch();
    }
    
    public function getName()
    {
        return $this-&gt;row["name"];
    }
    
    public function getAge()
    {
        return $this-&gt;row["age"];
    }
    
    public function getAddress()
    {
        return $this-&gt;row["address"];
    }
    
    public function getPhone()
    {
        return $this-&gt;row["phone"];
    }
    
    public function updateDetails($newAddress, $newPhone)
    {
        $stmt = $this-&gt;conn-&gt;prepare
            ("UPDATE people SET address=?, phone=? WHERE id=?");
        $stmt-&gt;bindParam (1, $newAddress);
        $stmt-&gt;bindParam (2, $newPhone);
        $stmt-&gt;bindParam (3, $this-&gt;id);
    }
}
?&gt;
</pre>
Script using the Person class:
<pre>&lt;?php
include("Person.php");

$conn=new PDO("mysql:host=localhost;dbname=peopledb", "username", "password");

$person = new Person ($conn, 123); // a Person object representing the Person with ID 123
echo $person-&gt;getName() . " " . $person-&gt;getAge(); // display details of Person
$person-&gt;updateDetails("123 Richmond Road", "07722444888"); // update address and phone number
?&gt;
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Note how the constructor loads the row corresponding to the Person with that
ID into the attribute <em>$row</em>, and the get...() methods return the corresponding fields from the row</li>
<li>Note also how updateDetails() performs the corresponding database UPDATE query</li>
<li>The advantage of this approach is that it keeps your PHP scripts "clean" and free from SQL queries;
your PHP scripts call methods of the Person class rather than doing the SQL queries directly</li>
<li>This makes your code easier to read and maintain, and, by keeping all the SQL in one place,
enhances security as there are less places in your code where you need to worry about SQL injection</li>
<li>The benefits of this are limited in the small PHP applications that you
have been working on so far, but in larger web applications, where we wish
to perform many operations on data returned from a database, storing the
data entities as objects can lead to cleaner, and easier to maintain, code
</li>
